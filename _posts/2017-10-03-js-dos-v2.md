Hi! I'am glad to present new version of js-dos. This version was released because old does not work in Chrome. This version was built with latest emscripten, and I hope that it works much stable. BTW, I plan to release v3 for games that can't work in normal mode and requires emterpreter feature. If you need first version of js-dos, then you should use `js-dos-api-v1.js` instead of `js-dos-api.js`.
