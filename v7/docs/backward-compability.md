js-dos v7 is better then 6.22 in many cases. But it targets on modern browsers.
It supports only wasm execution, so it's not possible to run js-dos in pure js mode.
In rare cases this can be important and js-dos 6.22 is only one option here.

However [js-dos bundle](overview.md#js-dos-bundle) is plain zip archive, so you can 
use them also with js-dos 6.22.
