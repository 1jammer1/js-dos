In this example you will learn how to use parts of `emulators-ui` with `three.js` renderer.
We will create rotating cube with digger game as on image.

<img alt="Result" src={useBaseUrl('img/threejs.jpg')} />

First you need to add `emulators.js` and `emulators-ui.js`:
```html
<script src="/v7/build/releases/latest/emulators/emulators.js"></script>
<script src="/v7/build/releases/latest/emulators-ui/emulators-ui.js"></script>
<script>
  emulators.pathPrefix = "/v7/build/releases/latest/emulators/";
```

Complete example:
```html title="examples/threejs.html"
{}
```
