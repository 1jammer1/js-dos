## Using emulators-ui components 

`emulators-ui` is a set of components that used to create js-dos player. You can use them one by one. In this example you will learn how to use parts of `emulators-ui` with `three.js` renderer.

For this example you should add `emulators.js` and `emulators-ui.js`:
```html
<script src="/v7/build/releases/latest/emulators/emulators.js"></script>
<script src="/v7/build/releases/latest/emulators-ui/emulators-ui.js"></script>
<script>
  emulators.pathPrefix = "/v7/build/releases/latest/emulators/";
```

Complete example:
```html title="examples/threejs.html"
{}
```
