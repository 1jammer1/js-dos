## Creating js-dos bundle

Please open in new tab our bundle generator [studio](https://dos.zone/en/studio). 
Click on `Browse` button, and choose program archive. In this guide we use [Dhrystone 2 Test](../bundles/dhry2.zip), 
read more below.

Next, you need to select executable that will be runned when DOS emulator starts. Please select `dhry_2.exe`.

On next step you can change various of dosbox options, but usually defaults is pretty good. You can scroll down and press
`create archive`.

Finally, you can download `js-dos bundle`.

## Performance testing

To measure performance we used variant of Dhrystone 2 Test originally taken from this [page](http://www.roylongbottom.org.uk/dhrystone%20results.htm). Original version used `clock()` to calculate delta time. Which is good for real pc, but does not very accurate for dosbox emulator. When `clock()` call happened modified version send `~>dtime` marker which intercepted by test page and used to calculate delta time with `performance.now()` from browser. Source code of modified test is [here](https://github.com/caiiiycuk/js-dos/tree/6.22/programms/dhry2).

Basically this test produce a lot of int operations and measure amount of operations (Dhrystones) produced per second. Output is a `VAX MIPS RATING` which is Drhystones per second divided by 1757 (is as DEC VAX 11/780 result).

To run this test we need import `emulators.js` and use our `js-dos bundle` to start test.

You can write JSX and use React components within your Markdown thanks to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => ( <span style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem',
    }}>{children}</span> );

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Docusaurus green</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#1877F2">Facebook blue</Highlight> are my favorite colors.

I can write **Markdown** alongside my _JSX_!
